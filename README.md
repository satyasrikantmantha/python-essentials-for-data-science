This repository aims to be master list of tutorials (with enough details) all major python libraries commonly used for Data Science. A number of references are used to build this repository, please look at the references section.

## Libraries

### NumPY
According to numpy.org:

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific
computing with Python. It contains among other things: 

* a powerful N-dimensional array object 
* sophisticated(broadcasting) functions 
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code 
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
